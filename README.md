✋ Hand Gesture Recognition using Deep Learning

This project focuses on developing a hand gesture recognition system using deep learning techniques to accurately identify and classify different hand gestures from images or real-time video streams. The system can be used for human-computer interaction (HCI), gesture-based control, sign language recognition, and augmented reality applications.

🚀 Features

✅ Real-time hand gesture detection using OpenCV✅ Accurate classification using CNN & Pretrained Models✅ Supports custom datasets & transfer learning✅ Gesture-based control for applications (e.g., volume control, media navigation)✅ Deployment options for desktop, web, or mobile applications

📌 Objectives

🎯 Accurately classify different hand gestures from images/videos🎯 Enable intuitive gesture-based control for various applications🎯 Implement real-time gesture recognition using a webcam

🏗️ Project Workflow

1️⃣ Dataset Collection & Preprocessing

Utilize datasets like LEAP Hand Gesture Dataset, ASL Hand Gesture Dataset, or Sign Language MNIST.

Apply data augmentation (rotation, scaling, flipping) to improve generalization.

Convert images to grayscale or apply edge detection (Canny, Sobel) for feature enhancement.

2️⃣ Model Development

Approaches:

CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) – For image-based classification.

Pretrained Models (VGG16, ResNet, MobileNet) – Transfer learning for improved accuracy.

MediaPipe Hand Tracking – Extracts hand landmarks for feature-based classification.

3️⃣ Training & Optimization

Use TensorFlow/Keras or PyTorch for model training.

Optimize using Adam, SGD, or RMSprop optimizers.

Apply cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning for better accuracy.

4️⃣ Real-time Gesture Recognition

Capture live video using OpenCV.

Detect and segment hands using MediaPipe or Haar cascades.

Classify gestures and map them to specific actions (e.g., volume control, cursor movement).

5️⃣ Evaluation & Deployment

Evaluate model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Convert trained models to TensorFlow Lite for mobile deployment.

Deploy as a web app using Flask or Streamlit.
