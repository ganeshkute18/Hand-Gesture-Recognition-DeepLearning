Project Overview
Project: Hand Gesture Recognition using Deep Learning
This project focuses on developing a hand gesture recognition model using deep learning techniques to identify and classify different hand gestures from images or video streams. The system can be used for human-computer interaction (HCI), gesture-based control, sign language recognition, and augmented reality applications.

Objectives
Accurately classify different hand gestures from images/videos.
Enable intuitive gesture-based control for various applications.
Implement real-time gesture detection using a webcam.

Methodology
1️ Dataset Collection & Preprocessing
Use datasets like ASL Hand Gesture Dataset, Sign Language MNIST, or create a custom dataset using OpenCV.
Data Augmentation (Rotation, Scaling, Flipping) to improve generalization.
Convert images to grayscale or preprocess them with edge detection (e.g., Canny, Sobel).

2️ Model Development
Approaches:
CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) – For image-based classification.
Pretrained Models (VGG16, ResNet, MobileNet) – For transfer learning and better accuracy.
MediaPipe Hand Tracking – For extracting hand landmarks and using them as features.

3️ Training & Optimization
Use TensorFlow/Keras or PyTorch for model training.
Optimize the model with Adam, SGD, or RMSprop optimizers.
Apply cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning for better accuracy.

4️ Real-time Gesture Recognition
Use OpenCV to capture live video frames.
Detect and segment hands using MediaPipe or OpenCV Haar cascades.
Classify gestures in real time and map them to specific actions (e.g., volume control, cursor movement)

5️ Evaluation & Deployment
Evaluate model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Convert the trained model to TensorFlow Lite for mobile deployment.
Deploy as a web app using Flask or Streamlit for easy interaction.

Technologies Used
Python
TensorFlow/Keras or PyTorch
OpenCV for image/video processing
MediaPipe for hand landmark detection
Flask/Streamlit for deployment

Expected Outcomes
A robust gesture recognition model with high accuracy.
Real-time gesture-controlled applications (e.g., controlling media, switching slides, or sign language recognition).
Easy deployment on PC or mobile devices.
